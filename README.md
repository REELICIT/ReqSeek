## Summary  
This replication package supports our paper titled: **ReqSeek: Transformer-Based Automatic Requirements Identification for Building Large Requirements Datasets**, which introduces a transformer-based approach (ReqSeek) for automatically identifying requirements in textual data. Many deep-learning methods require large datasets, but collecting labeled requirements data is challenging. Our work aims to facilitate the creation of large-scale requirements datasets for training AI models.

## Repository Content  
1. **[`datasets/`](./datasets/)**  
   - Contains our curated requirements datasets. 
   - Includes a tutorial on how to load and use them. 
   - ðŸ”’ All datasets (`ARID`, `SwaRD`, `BLINDED-DATASET`) are currently shared exclusively using HotCRP submission portal for peer review.
   - ðŸ“¢ We will **make them publicly available; open-source,** after the peer-review process is complete.

2. **[`ReqSeek/`](./ReqSeek/)**  
   - This is the ReqSeek model, it is our fine-tuned best-performing model (for more details refer to the paper)
